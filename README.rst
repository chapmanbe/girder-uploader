Girder Uploader
===============

girder_uploader works within a `Jupyter Noteboook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ to assist in the data upload process to a `Girder <https://github.com/girder/girder>`_ instance. Designed specifically for uploading and properly tagging medical image data, this tool allows the user to search `Bioportal <http://bioportal.bioontology.org/>`_'s database for keywords describing what is being uploaded. This information is stored as metadata within the file item on girder.

Installation
============
Use pip install from this directory::

  $ pip install -e .
